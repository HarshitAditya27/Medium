## Introduction 🐱‍💻

Created a Medium clone using React and Next.js. I have used Sanity for backend functionalities such as posting a blog, creating the blog page and comment functionaly with allowance from the author. 
<br>
<a href="">**Sanity**</a>  is a Content Management System which can be used in executing many functionalities. It also makes the backend tasks easy and automated !. **I have wrote a blog where I have explained What is a CMS and how you can use Sanity in your projects which can be very helpful in reducing you backend tasks. You can ckeck my blog by clicking <a href="">here</a>**
